# Learning Notes – SmartMine Maintenance System

This project helped me understand how real-world web applications are built.

Earlier, I thought frontend and backend work independently. Through this project, I learned how the frontend depends on APIs and how incorrect backend configuration (like missing CORS headers) can completely block communication.

I also learned how important it is to read console errors carefully instead of guessing.
