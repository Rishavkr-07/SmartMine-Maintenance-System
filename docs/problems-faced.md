# Problems Faced and Solutions

## Problem 1: Equipment cards not rendering
**Cause:** Frontend JavaScript was not fetching data correctly.
**Solution:** Fixed fetch logic and ensured correct DOM manipulation.

## Problem 2: CORS Error
**Error:** Access-Control-Allow-Origin blocked by browser.
**Cause:** Backend did not allow cross-origin requests.
**Solution:** Installed Flask-CORS and configured it properly.

This helped me understand browser security policies.
